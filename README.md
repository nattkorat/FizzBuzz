# FizzBuzz

Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with three exceptions. 
  - For numbers divisible by 3 and also divisible by 5, print `FizzBuzz`
  - For numbers divisible by 3 but not divisible by 5, print `Fizz`
  - For numbers divisible by 5 but not divisible by 3, print `Buzz`
  - Other cases, just print the number.

## Example:
  - Number `1` is not divisible by 3 and 5: `1`
  - Number `3` is divisible by `3` but not divisible by `5`: `Fizz`
  - Number `5` is divisible by `5` but not divisible by `3`: `Buzz`
  - Number `15` is divisible by `3` and by `5`: `FizzBuzz`
